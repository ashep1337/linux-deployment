</p>
First we begin at https://linuxmint.com/.<br />
  -Click "Download"<br />
  -Select which version you want.<br />
  -Click "Download again<br />
<p>

<br />

<p>
We will create a new folder for the next items to be saved in<br />
I named mine "ISO verify"<br />
  -Make sure all files are saved into the same folder<br />
Right click the two files sha256sum.txt and sha256sum.txt.gpg and "save link as" into your "ISO Verify" folder.<br />

Next we will go down to our download mirrors and pick a location closest to you. <br />
Download your ISO file and save into "ISO verify" folder.<br />

Navigate to https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html and scroll down to GnuPG binary releases<br />
  -Select "Download" for windows<br />
  -Install GnuPG<br />

Right Click "ISO verify" folder and select "Open in Terminal"<br />
Run this command in your terminal making sure to replace the filename with the name of your .iso file you chose. <br /> <br /> -- CertUtil -hashfile linuxmint-21.3-xfce-64bit.iso SHA256<br /><br />
This will take a minute to load but you will receive an output of something similar to this b284afcc298cc6f5da6ab4d483318c453b2074485974b71b16fdfc7256527cb1<br />
  <img src="Sha256_output.png"/>
Go into your "ISO verify" folder and open "sha256sum.txt and ensure that your "hash" (string of letters and numbers) matches one of the hashes listed in this folder.<br />
This verifies that the .iso file we downloaded is authentic and not a virus of some sort.<br />

</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
Next we will download rufus.exe from https://rufus.ie/en/<br />
Install rufus and run rufus.exe<br />
At this time make sure the hard drive or flash drive you want to download Linux to is plugged in and operational.<br />
The drive will be formatted and all data will be lost.<br />
Click "Select" under the Boot selection tab and select your .iso file<br />
All default settings should remain the same.<br />
Click start at the bottom<br />
You now have a bootable drive that has linux mint on it!<br />

</p>
Now we will boot into the BIOS to change our boot configuration.<br />
Your computer may have you press "Del" or one of the "F" keys while booting up in order to enter BIOS mode<br />
Otherwise you can hold "Shift" while pressing restart and navigate through the menus in order to get to "UEFI settings"<br />
A comprehensive guide can be found here https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/bios-keys-to-access-your-firmware,5732.html<br />
Once we are in the BIOS we will want to change the settings so that our media we just created boots first<br />
A guide for that can be found here https://www.lifewire.com/change-the-boot-order-in-bios-2624528<br />
When the boot order is properly switched we should boot into our linux environment for the first time.<br />
There will be a desktop icon that allows you to install Linux permenantly on to your hard drive from there.
